# vATIS Profiles - updated from https://github.com/lennycolton/vATIS-Profiles
A collection of vATIS Profiles for UK controllers. All civilian airports inside controlled airspace are included, as well as a few others. The profiles are organised for ease of use by approach units, so the following profiles contain more than one airport:

- Belfast - EGAA, EGAC
- Channel Islands - EGJJ, EGJB
- Essex - EGSS, EGGW, EGSC
- Heathrow - EGLL, EGWU
- Northumberland - EGNT, EGNV
- Severn - EGFF, EGGD, EGSY
- Thames - EGLC, EGKB, EGMC
- Warton - EGNH, EGNO

Contributions are always welcome - feel free to pull request in additions or corrections!
The profiles contain pre made airport conditions (see changelog for full list)
